------------------- GUIDE --------------------
In the project there are two Scheduler class. One of them is RRScheduler, which is the implementation of
the Round Robin algorithm. The other class is LotteryScheduler, the implementation of the Lottery algorithm.
In order to run RRScheduler you must uncomment the lines 24 and 71 in Run class, and comment the lines 25 and 72 in the same class. 
If you want to run LotteryScheduler you must do the opposite, it means you must uncomment the lines 25 and 72, and comment the lines
24 and 71 in Run class.

After choosing the Scheduler you want to run you execute the Assembler class in order to compile the .asm file. Then you run the Run class
to execute the chosen Scheduler.

NOTE: If you want to change the .asm file that you want to run, you must rename the chosen file to file.asm
